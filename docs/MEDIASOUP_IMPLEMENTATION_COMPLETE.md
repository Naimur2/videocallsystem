# MediaSoup Client Integration - Implementation Complete âœ…

## Overview

Successfully integrated MediaSoup client-side functionality into the video call application, transforming it from a basic chat app with camera previews into a fully functional peer-to-peer video calling system.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. MediaSoup Client Service (`videocall/src/services/mediaSoupClientService.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Handles all MediaSoup client-side operations
- **Key Features**:
  - Device initialization with RTP capabilities
  - WebRTC transport creation (send & receive)
  - Media production (audio, video, screen sharing)
  - Media consumption from remote participants
  - ICE server configuration with TURN support
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 2. Enhanced Video Call Store (`videocall/src/store/videoCallStore.ts`)

- **MediaSoup State Added**:

  - `isMediaSoupInitialized`: Tracks initialization status
  - `rtpCapabilities`: Server RTP capabilities
  - `sendTransport` & `recvTransport`: WebRTC transports
  - `audioProducer`, `videoProducer`, `screenProducer`: Media producers
  - `remoteStreams`: Map of remote participant streams

- **MediaSoup Actions Implemented**:
  - `initializeMediaSoup()`: Initialize device with server capabilities
  - `createTransports()`: Create WebRTC send/receive transports
  - `startProducing()`: Start producing local media
  - `stopProducing()`: Stop media production
  - `consumeMedia()`: Consume media from remote participants
  - `cleanupMediaSoup()`: Clean up all MediaSoup resources

### 3. Socket.IO Event Extensions (`videocall/src/types/index.ts`)

- **Client-to-Server Events**:

  - `getRtpCapabilities`: Get server RTP capabilities
  - `createWebRtcTransport`: Create transport on server
  - `connectTransport`: Connect transport with DTLS parameters
  - `produce`: Start producing media
  - `consume`: Consume media from producer
  - `resumeConsumer`: Resume paused consumer

- **Server-to-Client Events**:
  - `newProducer`: Notification of new producer from participant
  - `producerClosed`: Notification when producer is closed

### 4. Integration Flow

#### Room Join Process:

1. User joins room via Socket.IO
2. On successful `roomJoined` event:
   - Initialize MediaSoup device with server RTP capabilities
   - Create send and receive WebRTC transports
   - Start producing local media (audio/video) if available
   - Ready to consume media from other participants

#### Media Production:

1. Local media tracks are produced through send transport
2. Server creates corresponding producers
3. Other participants are notified via `newProducer` event
4. Remote participants automatically consume the new media

#### Media Consumption:

1. When `newProducer` event received from server
2. Automatically create consumer for the new producer
3. Add received MediaStream to `remoteStreams` map
4. Stream becomes available to video components

#### Cleanup Process:

1. On room leave, all MediaSoup resources are cleaned up
2. Transports closed, producers stopped
3. Remote streams cleared from state

## Technical Configuration

### TURN Server Integration

- **External IP**: `103.168.206.14:3478`
- **Credentials**: `mediasoup:mediasoup123`
- **Protocols**: UDP/TCP on ports 3478 (STUN/TURN) and 5349 (TURNS)

### MediaSoup Server

- **Workers**: 1 worker initialized
- **RTP Port Range**: 10000-10100 (mapped in Docker)
- **WebRTC Transport**: Supports both UDP and TCP
- **Codecs**: Full codec support via RTP capabilities

## Testing Instructions

### Local Testing

1. Start production environment: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`
2. Access via ngrok URL: `https://satisfaction-budget-symbols-happens.trycloudflare.com`
3. Join meeting from multiple devices/browsers
4. Verify video/audio streaming between participants

### Expected Behavior

- âœ… Users can see each other's video streams
- âœ… Audio communication works between participants
- âœ… Screen sharing replaces video feed for sharing participant
- âœ… Connection remains stable (no disconnections)
- âœ… Multiple participants supported
- âœ… Graceful handling of participant join/leave

## Key Improvements Made

### Before (Issues):

- Users could only see their own camera locally
- No peer-to-peer video streaming
- Screen sharing not working
- Users getting disconnected after few minutes
- Essentially just a chat app with camera previews

### After (Fixed):

- Full peer-to-peer video calling functionality
- MediaSoup WebRTC integration
- Proper transport management
- TURN server support for NAT traversal
- Automatic media consumption from new participants
- Robust error handling and cleanup
