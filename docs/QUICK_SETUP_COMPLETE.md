# MediaSoup Video Call - Quick Setup Complete! 🎉

## ✅ What's Working

### Infrastructure Services (Docker)
- **PostgreSQL**: Running on port 5432 ✅
- **Redis**: Running on port 6379 ✅  
- **Nginx**: Running on port 80 ✅

### Application Status
- **Frontend**: Next.js ready to run on port 3001 ✅
- **Backend**: Built but needs MediaSoup worker fix for WSL ⚠️

## 🚀 How to Access

1. **Infrastructure**: All database and cache services are ready
   ```bash
   docker ps  # Check running containers
   ```

2. **Start Frontend**: 
   ```bash
   cd videocall && bun run dev
   ```

3. **Access Application**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3001
   - Database: localhost:5432 (mediasoup/mediasoup_password)
   - Redis: localhost:6379
   - Nginx Proxy: http://localhost:80

## 🔧 Next Steps

To complete the setup:

1. **Fix MediaSoup Worker** (WSL compatibility issue):
   - The backend needs MediaSoup worker binaries for WSL
   - This can be resolved by running the backend in Docker or using Windows

2. **Start ngrok Tunnel**:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 80
   ```

## ⚡ Performance Notes

- **No more infinite builds**: Using simple pre-built images
- **Fast startup**: Infrastructure services start in seconds
- **Modular**: Each component can be developed independently

## 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
# Stop all services
docker compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml down

# Start infrastructure only
docker compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml up -d

# Start frontend
cd videocall && bun run dev

# Start backend (when MediaSoup is fixed)
cd videocallbackend && npm start
```

The project is now set up with fast, reliable infrastructure and the frontend is ready to run!
