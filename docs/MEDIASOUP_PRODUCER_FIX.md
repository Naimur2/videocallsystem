# MediaSoup Video Stream Sharing Fix

## Issue Identified
Two users were connecting to meetings but **NO video streams were being shared** between them because:

1. **Missing Producer Methods**: The MediaSoup client service was missing critical methods:
   - `produce()` - Called by video call store but didn't exist
   - `closeProducer()` - Called but didn't exist
   - `consume()` - Called but didn't exist
   - `cleanup()` - Called but didn't exist

2. **Broken Backend Communication**: The `produce` event handler in send transport was creating dummy producer IDs instead of communicating with the MediaSoup backend.

3. **Type Mismatches**: Method signatures didn't match the expected parameters (RTCConfiguration vs RTCIceServer[]).

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Missing Methods to MediaSoup Client Service

**File**: `videocall/src/services/mediaSoupClientService.ts`

```typescript
// Producer management methods
async produce(kind: "audio" | "video", track: MediaStreamTrack): Promise<any>
async closeProducer(producerId: string): Promise<void>

// Consumer management methods  
async consume(consumerParams: any): Promise<any>

// Management methods
getProducers(): Map<string, any>
getConsumers(): Map<string, any>
cleanup(): void
```

### 2. Fixed Backend Communication for Producer Creation

**Before** (Broken):
```typescript
this.sendTransport.on("produce", async ({ kind }: any, callback: any, errback: any) => {
  callback({ id: `producer_${Date.now()}` }); // Dummy ID!
});
```

**After** (Fixed):
```typescript
this.sendTransport.on("produce", async ({ kind, rtpParameters }: any, callback: any, errback: any) => {
  if (socket) {
    socket.emit("produce", {
      transportId: this.sendTransport.id,
      kind,
      rtpParameters
    }, (response: any) => {
      if (response.error) {
        errback(new Error(response.error));
      } else {
        callback({ id: response.id }); // Real backend producer ID!
      }
    });
  }
});
```

### 3. Updated Method Signatures

**Fixed createSendTransport**:
```typescript
async createSendTransport(
  transportInfo: any,
  rtcConfig?: RTCConfiguration,  // ✅ Correct type
  socket?: any                   // ✅ Added socket for backend communication
)
```

**Fixed createReceiveTransport**:
```typescript
async createReceiveTransport(
  transportInfo: any,
  rtcConfig?: RTCConfiguration   // ✅ Correct type
)
```

### 4. Updated Video Call Store

**File**: `videocall/src/store/videoCallStore.ts`

```typescript
const sendTransport = await mediaSoupClientService.createSendTransport(
  sendTransportParams,
  rtcConfig,
  socket  // ✅ Pass socket for backend communication
);
```

## Expected Results

After these fixes:

1. **Producer Creation**: When users join meetings, their video/audio tracks will create actual MediaSoup producers on the backend
2. **Backend Logs**: Should show `createWebRtcTransport`, `producer creation`, and `newProducer` events
3. **Video Sharing**: Users should see each other's video streams instead of "No Stream" placeholders
4. **Stream Management**: Proper producer/consumer lifecycle management

## Testing

1. Join meeting with two users: https://dense-res-variables-accommodation.trycloudflare.com/meeting/f9b1nz1g6k6
2. Verify backend logs show MediaSoup producer creation events
3. Confirm both users can see each other's video streams
4. Test audio/video toggle functionality

## Technical Impact

This fix resolves the core MediaSoup WebRTC functionality, enabling proper multi-party video calling as intended by the application architecture.
