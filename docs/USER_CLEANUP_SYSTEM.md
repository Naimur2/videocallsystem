# 🧹 Enhanced User Cleanup System

## Problem Solved

**Issue**: Users closing tabs or leaving meetings abruptly would remain "ghost" connected in the room, consuming server resources and confusing other participants.

**Root Causes**:

- `beforeunload` events are unreliable
- Network disconnections may not trigger proper cleanup
- Multi-tab scenarios create orphaned sessions
- WebRTC resources (producers/consumers) not properly released

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Backend Heartbeat System**

- **Ping/Pong**: Client sends ping every 30 seconds, server responds with pong
- **Session Tracking**: User sessions include `lastSeen` timestamp
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Stale sessions (>2 minutes inactive) are automatically removed
- **Resource Cleanup**: MediaSoup producers/consumers properly closed on cleanup

#### Backend Changes:

```typescript
// Socket events added:
socket.on("ping", () => socket.emit("pong"));
socket.on("beforeDisconnect", (data) => handleGracefulDisconnect(data));

// Automatic cleanup every 30 seconds:
setInterval(() => cleanupStaleSessions(), 30000);
```

### 2. **Frontend Connection Management**

- **Socket Manager**: Enhanced with heartbeat and current room tracking
- **Graceful Disconnect**: Sends `beforeDisconnect` signal before closing
- **Visibility API**: Detects tab switching/minimizing
- **Enhanced beforeunload**: Shows confirmation if user is in active call

#### Frontend Changes:

```typescript
// Heartbeat every 30 seconds:
setInterval(() => socket.emit("ping"), 30000);

// Enhanced beforeunload:
beforeUnload: "You are in a video call. Are you sure you want to leave?";

// Graceful disconnect:
socket.emit("beforeDisconnect", { roomId });
```

### 3. **User Cleanup Manager**

- **Tab Visibility**: Monitors when tabs become inactive/active
- **Focus Events**: Handles window focus/blur
- **Automatic Heartbeat**: Sends ping when tab becomes active
- **Force Cleanup**: Manual cleanup trigger for emergency situations

## 🔧 How It Works

### Normal Operation:

1. **Join**: User joins room → heartbeat starts → cleanup manager activates
2. **Active**: Client pings server every 30s → server updates `lastSeen`
3. **Leave**: User clicks leave → `beforeDisconnect` → proper cleanup
4. **Tab Switch**: Visibility API detects → sends heartbeat on return

### Emergency Cleanup:

1. **Tab Closed Abruptly**: No beforeunload → heartbeat stops
2. **Server Detection**: After 2 minutes of no ping → marks as stale
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: Server removes user → notifies other participants
4. **Resource Release**: MediaSoup transports/producers closed

### Multi-Tab Scenarios:

1. **New Tab Joins**: Duplicate detection → shows "meeting switched" page
2. **Old Tab**: Receives switch notification → graceful cleanup
3. **Session Transfer**: User session cleanly transferred to new tab

## 📊 Benefits

### For Users:

- ✅ **No Ghost Connections**: Users properly removed when they leave
- ✅ **Reliable Multi-Tab**: Smooth experience when switching tabs
- ✅ **Quick Rejoin**: Easy to rejoin if accidentally closed
- ✅ **Clear Status**: Always know who's actually in the meeting

### For System:

- ✅ **Resource Efficiency**: No orphaned MediaSoup resources
- ✅ **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of stale sessions
- ✅ **Scalability**: Server can handle more concurrent users
- ✅ **Stability**: Reduced memory leaks and zombie connections

## 🚀 Testing the System

### Docker Environment Ready:

```bash
# Start the enhanced system
.\start-dev.ps1

# Frontend: http://localhost:3002
# Backend: http://localhost:3001
```

### Test Scenarios:

#### 1. **Normal Leave**:

- Join meeting → Click leave → Check user removed properly

#### 2. **Tab Close**:

- Join meeting → Close tab abruptly → Wait 2 minutes → Check cleanup

#### 3. **Multi-Tab**:

- Join in Tab 1 → Copy URL → Open Tab 2 → Check switch behavior

#### 4. **Network Issues**:

- Join meeting → Disconnect network → Reconnect → Check status

#### 5. **Tab Switching**:

- Join meeting → Switch to other app → Return → Check heartbeat

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### Backend Logs:

```
[Socket.IO] 🏓 Received ping from client
[Socket.IO] Cleaning up stale session: user@email.com in room abc123
[Socket.IO] Client disconnected gracefully
```

### Frontend Console:

```
[SocketManager] 🏓 Sending ping to server
[UserCleanup] Enhanced cleanup handlers setup
[VideoCall] Sending graceful disconnect signal
```

### Health Check:

```powershell
# Check system health
.\health-check.ps1
```

## 📈 Performance Impact

- **Minimal Overhead**: Heartbeat every 30s (tiny packets)
- **Automatic Scaling**: Cleanup prevents resource accumulation
- **Better UX**: Users see accurate participant lists
- **Reliability**: Fewer stuck connections and errors

The enhanced cleanup system ensures your MediaSoup video call application handles user disconnections gracefully and maintains system stability! 🎯
