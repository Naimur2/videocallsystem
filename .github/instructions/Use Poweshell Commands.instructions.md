Use Poweshell Commands.instructions. Put all readme docs inside docs folder in the base directory. Check files directory before running commands. Check if there are running processes that may interfere with the commands. Use semicolon to separate commands in a single line. When there are any existing processes that may interfere with the commands, make sure to create separate terminal instances for that if needed. Create a backup then change files and then delete backup so that if anything goes wrong, you can restore the original files.
